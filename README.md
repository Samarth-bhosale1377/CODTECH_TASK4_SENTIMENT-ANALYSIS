💬 Task 4 – Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)



📘 Overview



This task focuses on performing Sentiment Analysis on textual data (such as customer reviews or tweets) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to identify and classify emotions expressed in the text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral, helping organizations understand customer opinions and improve their products or services.
Using Python-based NLP libraries, this task demonstrates end-to-end text analysis — from cleaning and preprocessing to model-based sentiment classification and visualization of insights.



🎯 Objectives





To preprocess and analyze textual data using NLP techniques.


To determine the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) of each text entry.


To visualize sentiment distribution and key textual patterns.




🧠 Key Steps Performed




Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized text data (removed punctuation, stopwords, etc.).


Sentiment Scoring: Used the TextBlob library to calculate polarity and subjectivity of reviews.


Classification: Categorized sentiments into Positive, Negative, and Neutral.





Visualization:




Bar chart showing sentiment distribution.


Word cloud representing frequently used words in reviews.







💡 Insights





Majority of reviews were positive, indicating customer satisfaction.


Negative reviews highlighted issues related to packaging or quality.


Frequent keywords (e.g., “product”, “quality”, “love”) provided clear context of user experiences.
